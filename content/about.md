Hi my name is Rory and I'm a software engineer based out of Austin, TX.

I've built a solid understanding of web technology over the past few years and have been exporing other skillsets such as data science, game programming, and business recently.

This blog has been created as a central hub for me to post any content I create going forward based on topics that I am proficient in as well as topics I am exploring for my own personal satisfication.
